meta_description: >
  The Anthropocene represents the most recent geological epoch in Earth's history, during which humans have become the most influential species and are having a significant impact on the planet's climate and ecosystems. The intensification of anthropogenic impacts has resulted in a break from the relatively stable conditions that characterized the Holocene epoch.
