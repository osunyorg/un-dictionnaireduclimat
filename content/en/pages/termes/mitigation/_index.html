  Climate change mitigation refers to any action or effort taken to reduce the levels of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere in order to prevent further global warming. Mitigation can involve reducing the sources of these gases, for example through the use of new technologies and renewable energy, or strengthening the "sinks" such as forests and soils that store these gases.
