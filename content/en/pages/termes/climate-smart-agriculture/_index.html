  Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach that identifies the measures needed to transform and reorient agricultural systems to effectively support agricultural development and ensure food security in the face of climate change. It has three main objectives: sustainable increase in agricultural productivity and income (food security); adaptation and building resilience to the impacts of climate change (adaptation); and reduction and/or removal of greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation).
