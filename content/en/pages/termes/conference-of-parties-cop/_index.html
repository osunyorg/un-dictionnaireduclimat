  The Conference of the Parties, or COP, is the highest decision-making body of a convention. All states that are parties to a treaty are represented at the COP. During these usually annual meetings, the implementation of the treaty and related legal instruments is assessed. In addition, decisions are taken to promote its effective implementation, including institutional and administrative arrangements. The best known are the COPs under the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).
